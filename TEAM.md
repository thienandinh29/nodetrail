# TEAM — 24-hour parallel build (5 people + AI agents)

Goal: the demo in `SPEC.md` ("Competition demo"): a judge names **any** topic (or uploads a file) and NodeTrail
builds a cited learning path live. No subject is prepared in advance. Every agent reads this file; follow it exactly.

Before H0, ask the organizers: (1) are AI coding agents allowed, (2) may the textbook library be indexed before
the contest, (3) may code written before the contest be reused, (4) how long is the final-round demo (the last pitch
was cut to 3 minutes). If (3) is "no", start a fresh repo with this same plan; (4) decides the demo script.

The plan has two versions, chosen by the answers to (2) and (3); see "Before H0 checklist":
- **Pre-H0 allowed:** the draft `schemas.py`, the throwaway-schema `conftest.py`, migration `0003` and (if (2) is
  "yes") the library download + index are done before H0. The timeline below still holds; those rows become checks.
- **Everything from H0:** follow the timeline exactly as written.

## Rules that make parallel work possible
1. **Contracts first.** P1 drafts data formats, API shapes and Python interfaces by **H1**; frozen at **H3**.
2. **Stay in your lane.** Edit only the paths your lane owns. Need a change elsewhere? Ask the owner.
3. **Fixtures, golden topics and stubs until integration.** No lane waits for another: P4's golden topics give real
   data from H3, P5 builds on mock JSON from H1, P2's stubs serve every route by H3.
4. **Small PRs, CI green.** P2 merges routine PRs; contract or architecture changes need P1's approval. Nobody pushes
   to `main`.
5. **Spec Kit for every lane (the examiner asked for it):** `/speckit-specify` → `/speckit-plan` → `/speckit-tasks`
   in the folder Spec Kit creates under `specs/` before an agent writes code; one page per document. Plans follow the
   contracts in this file (link, never copy them). The constitution (`.specify/`) is written from `CLAUDE.md`'s
   principles and repeats "edit only your lane's paths", so `/speckit-implement` stays in the lane. Work stays on the
   lane branch: if Spec Kit creates a feature branch, merge the spec back into the lane branch and delete it.
   **Exempt** (a short PR description is enough): bug fixes, changes under ~30 min that stay inside an existing spec,
   and everything after the H18 freeze. A change that adds a route, a contract field or a new module is never exempt.
6. **Integration before the checkpoint.** Pieces due at H8 are merged by **H7**; H7–H8 is the first end-to-end run.
7. **Feature freeze at H18.** After that, only bug fixes, rehearsal and the backup video.

## Lanes

| Person | Lane | Owns (only edits these) | Delivers |
|---|---|---|---|
| **P1** (lead, ML/AI engineer; 2 agents: retrieval + engine) | Lead + ML core | `app/schemas.py` (contracts), `app/engine/` (`bkt.py`, `srs.py`, `graph.py`, `placement.py`, `trace.py`), `app/rag/` (`embed.py`, `retrieve.py`, `rerank.py`, `notebook.py`, `store.py`, `ingest.py`), `data/eval/`, `tests/engine/`, `tests/rag/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `TEAM.md`, `SPEC.md`, `PLAN.md`, `MAP.md`, `team/` | Contracts (draft H1, frozen H3); **retrieval**: `embed.py` (TEI client + managed-API fallback), cited retrieval, optional reranker, retrieval evaluation (golden topic #1 before H8, the rest after), library indexing code (`ingest.py`; P2 runs it), `source_uri` per chunk; **learner model**: BKT/FSRS (traced), root-cause tracing, graph-walk placement, `DecisionTrace`; **evaluation design** for guardrail metrics and the H8 model test; H8/H12 decisions; the algorithm part of the pitch. **No server or Docker work.** |
| **P2** (backend/DevOps; 2 agents: infra + services) | Platform | `apps/api/app/main.py`, `app/api/__init__.py`, `app/config.py`, `app/db.py`, `app/services/` (database layer), `app/jobs/`, `app/observability/`, `supabase/migrations/`, `apps/api/tests/conftest.py`, `scripts/seed.py`, `scripts/pregenerate.py`, `docker/`, `.github/`, `pyproject.toml`/`uv.lock`, `.specify/` | Repo, CI, Spec Kit setup (CLI, `specify init`, constitution); API stubs from P1's contracts by H3; **GPU VM + AWS backup VM**, Docker, named Cloudflare Tunnel, GHCR/Watchtower deploy, budget alerts; **TEI container serving bge-m3** (and the reranker if used) on the VM (H0–H2) and the temporary indexing GPU VM; **runs the library indexing** with P1's code (H5–H7, size check per book, HNSW after load); `topic_jobs` queue + worker + SSE; structlog + Langfuse; database layer (attempts, mastery, traces, review cards); tests on a throwaway schema per run; merging green PRs; pre-generated topics |
| **P3** (backend) | Agents & integration | `app/research/`, `app/uploads/`, `app/llm/`, `app/graders/`, `app/api/learn.py`, `app/api/tutor.py`, `app/api/topics.py`, `data/sources/`, `scripts/build_library.*`, `tests/research/`, `tests/uploads/`, `tests/llm/`, `tests/graders/`, `tests/api/` | Allowlist + textbook downloader/HTML reader; **full library download H1–H5** (P2 runs the indexing); **Deep Research agent**; uploaded-file reader (PDF/DOCX/link); **LLM gateway** (Vertex AI → Bedrock → OpenRouter, Vertex by H3 and Bedrock by H5, per-tier routing, model roles incl. the cross-family verifier rule); MCQ grading; the **API routes** that connect P1's engine and retrieval, P2's database layer and P4's content/tutor to the web |
| **P4** (careful, detail-oriented) | Content & tutor | `app/content/`, `app/guardrails/`, `app/tutor/`, `data/golden/`, `data/kg/`, `data/items/`, `data/guardrails/`, `tests/content/`, `tests/guardrails/`, `tests/tutor/` | **Golden topics first (H0–H3):** 2–3 hand-checked topics (source chunks, graph, ~15 items each) used as test data, labelled sample and demo fallback; content pipeline (sources → Knowledge Graph via **long-context extraction with chunk-ID markers** → MCQs with a misconception per wrong option); **verification gate**; `guardrails/metrics.py`; **Socratic tutor** prompts and hint ladder (Vietnamese, cited, never the final answer) |
| **P5** (frontend/design) | Web app | `apps/web/`, `assets/sena/` | Next.js app on Vercel, built on **mock JSON from H1**: topic input + file upload, research-trail screen, knowledge map (React Flow + `dagre`), learning + tutor screens, **"Vì sao?" panel** rendering `DecisionTrace`, "open source page" on citations (`source_uri` + page), Free/Pro switch, Vietnamese i18n, **backup video**; the agent reads designs through **MCP** (Figma MCP for the screens, shadcn MCP for components, a browser MCP to check the running app) |

## Stack (decided; changes go through P1)
- **Web:** Next.js (App Router, TypeScript strict), Tailwind + shadcn/ui, React Flow with **`dagre` auto-layout
  from H0** (never hand-computed x/y; every topic produces a differently shaped graph); deployed on **Vercel**.
- **Cloud (organizer credits, both open at H0):** **Google Cloud is primary, AWS is backup**; swap the roles if AWS
  gets a GPU first. Google credits cover Cloud Run, Vertex AI and other GCP services (amount and GPU access not yet
  confirmed), on each member's **own Google account**. **P2 owns the product project** on P2's credit; P1 and P3 join it
  with their own logins, passwords are never shared, and other members' credits stay in reserve. The VM and worker use a
  service account, never a personal login; its key goes only in `.env` or the password manager. Do not sign the product
  project in to Antigravity (it spends the same credit). Avoid a personal card on the billing account: budget alerts
  warn but do not stop spending. AWS gives each
  member's new root account up to $200 ($100 at signup + $100 from tasks); credits do not pool, so **P2's account** runs
  Bedrock and the backup VM, **P1 keeps a backup account**, **P3 gets a Bedrock-only IAM user** in P2's account at H0,
  and P3–P5 can create accounts later as reserve. Region: Singapore (`asia-southeast1` / `ap-southeast-1`),
  next to Supabase. Budget alerts on every account in use; root accounts get MFA and no access keys (use IAM users).
- **API host (P2):** Python 3.12, FastAPI, Pydantic v2, `uv`, in Docker on a **GPU VM** on the primary cloud (spec below).
  The backup cloud keeps a **stopped VM with the same image and compose file**, started only if the primary fails.
  Exposed with a **named Cloudflare Tunnel on the team's own domain** (never `trycloudflare.com`: its URL changes on
  every restart and the web app would point at a dead address); `cloudflared` runs with `--protocol http2`. **The VM
  opens no ports to the internet**; all traffic goes through the tunnel. All containers use `restart: unless-stopped`.
  CORS: the Vercel domain and `http://localhost:3000` from H0; shared API key between web and API.
- **Deploy (P2):** Vercel deploys the web app on merge to `main`. For the API, GitHub Actions builds the image and pushes
  it to GHCR; **Watchtower** on the VM pulls new images automatically. Manual fallback on the VM:
  `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`. P2 keeps a VM setup script (Docker, NVIDIA Container Toolkit,
  GHCR login, cloudflared, Watchtower) so the backup VM can be rebuilt in minutes.
- **Image (P2):** multi-stage build with `uv`: dependencies in a stable layer, `src/` copied last, so a normal merge pulls
  only a few MB. The API image has **no ML runtime** (no PyTorch/ONNX): bge-m3 runs in the separate **TEI container**
  (Hugging Face Text Embeddings Inference), whose weights live on the VM disk and are bind-mounted
  (`/models/bge-m3:/data`). TEI has GPU and CPU images; a CPU-only VM uses the CPU image.
- **Jobs (24 h, P2):** a `topic_jobs` table in Postgres is the queue. The worker is a **separate compose service** from
  the same image (`command: python -m app.worker`), never inside uvicorn; it claims jobs with
  `SELECT … FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`. Deep Research runs 3–8 min, never inside a request. Redis + `arq` after the contest.
- **Progress (SSE, P2):** `GET /topics/{id}/events` sends a heartbeat every 15–20 s (Cloudflare drops idle connections
  after ~100 s), with `Cache-Control: no-cache`. The web app reconnects automatically and reloads state from
  `GET /topics/{id}` (backed by `topic_jobs`).
- **Data:** Supabase cloud — Postgres + pgvector (`halfvec`), Storage (uploads). Auth after the contest.
  Free tier is 500 MB: **chunk budget ~30,000 (8–10 textbooks)**, chosen to match the pre-generated topics; check
  the database size after each book and stop at ~350 MB; build the HNSW index after loading, not row by row.
  **Migration `0003` (`halfvec`) must be merged before bulk indexing**, or the whole library is indexed twice. It
  changes `chunks.embedding` to `halfvec(1024)`, drops the HNSW index (rebuilt with `halfvec_cosine_ops` once loading
  finishes) and renames `chunks.url` (from `0002`) to `source_uri`; the same PR updates `store.py` and `retrieve.py`
  (`::halfvec(1024)` casts, `source_uri`).
  Fallback if the library must be bigger: Supabase Pro for one month. Every chunk stores `source_uri` (web URL, or the
  Supabase Storage path of an uploaded file) plus `page`, so the web app can open the original page of a citation.
- **Embeddings:** BAAI/bge-m3 (1024 dims) served by a **TEI container** on the API VM (P2 deploys it in H0–H2; the
  reranker `bge-reranker-v2-m3` can run in a second TEI container if P1 decides at H8). **Only TEI holds the model**;
  the API and the worker both call it over HTTP on the VM (`TEI_URL`), with an async client so the event loop is never
  blocked. **P1 writes `embed.py` and `retrieve.py`** against TEI. Bulk indexing runs the same TEI image on a
  short-lived GPU VM (deleted right after; Colab as fallback). Fallbacks: Hugging Face hosted bge-m3, or a managed
  multilingual embedding API on Bedrock/Vertex (e.g. a 1024-dim multilingual model) selected by `EMBEDDING_BACKEND` —
  **a different model means incompatible vectors, so switching requires re-indexing the library.**
- **LLM (P3):** one gateway, `app/llm/`, with provider adapters: **Vertex AI (primary, on credits)**, **Bedrock**, and
  **OpenRouter** (last fallback). `app/llm/routing.yaml` maps (tier, task) → an ordered list of `provider:model`; the
  gateway tries them in order on errors or rate limits. **free** = cheap models (e.g. Gemini Flash on Vertex), Nhanh mode
  only, no web search; **pro** = strong models (e.g. Claude on Vertex or Bedrock) + Deep Research. Exact model IDs chosen
  after the H8 Vietnamese quality test (designed by P1). On OpenRouter avoid `:free` model variants (rate limits).
  **Model roles:**
  - *Graph extraction / Deep Research reading:* a long-context Gemini model on Vertex reads a whole textbook or chapter
    set in one call; the text is sent **with chunk-ID markers** and every concept must cite them.
  - *Verifier (verification gate):* **always a different model family from the generator** (e.g. Gemini generates,
    Claude on Bedrock verifies), so a model never grades its own output (self-preference bias). Enforced in
    `routing.yaml`.
  - *Socratic tutor:* Pro = Claude on Bedrock, Free = a cheap model; confirmed or changed by the H8 Vietnamese test.
- **Observability (24 h, P2):** `structlog` JSON logs (`request_id`, `topic_id`, `tier`) + Langfuse for every LLM call
  (model, latency, cost); the Langfuse dashboard is shown at the end of the demo. After the contest:
  OpenTelemetry → Grafana Cloud, Sentry.
- **Engine (P1):** BKT (mastery), `fsrs` (reviews), graph rules (placement, remediation). Pure functions, tested.
- **Tests without Docker (P2, before H0 if allowed, otherwise the first task of H0–H1):** `tests/conftest.py` creates a **throwaway schema per run** (create → migrate →
  drop) instead of a throwaway database, so every member runs the full suite against **their own free Supabase dev
  project**. No Docker and no bge-m3 on laptops (tests use the fake embedder). CI keeps its own Postgres service.
- **CI:** pytest + ruff required; mypy runs but only warns. Playwright end-to-end tests after the contest;
  during the contest P5 keeps a manual end-to-end checklist.
- **Typed web client:** P5 generates TypeScript types from FastAPI's OpenAPI with `openapi-typescript`, so a contract
  change breaks the web build instead of the demo. Until the stubs exist (H3), P5 uses mock JSON matching P1's H1 draft.

### API VM spec (P2)
| | With GPU (recommended) | CPU only (no GPU quota yet) |
|---|---|---|
| Machine | Google Cloud `g2-standard-4` (1× L4) or `n1-standard-4` + 1× T4; AWS `g4dn.xlarge` (1× T4) | 8 vCPU, 32 GB RAM |
| RAM | 16 GB | 32 GB |
| Disk | 50 GB SSD (images + bge-m3 weights) | 50 GB SSD |
| OS | Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 + NVIDIA driver + NVIDIA Container Toolkit | Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 |
| bge-m3 | TEI GPU image | TEI CPU image |
| Region | Singapore | Singapore |

Acceptance at H3: query embedding < ~1 s per Vietnamese question on the VM. Bulk-indexing GPU VM is deleted after use;
the backup VM stays stopped until needed.

### Before H0 checklist
- P1, **ask the organizers now** (cloud opens only at H0; own Google accounts confirmed): **How much credit per member**
  (the guide mentions $5; about $5 means the VM moves to AWS and Google keeps Vertex only)? Can it use GPUs on Compute
  Engine, and with what quota? **When does the credit expire or access close** (the final demo must still run)? Does the
  AWS credit need a card, and does the free account plan allow GPU instances and Bedrock?
- P2: Cloudflare account + a cheap domain + a named tunnel on it; Vercel account linked to the repo; Supabase demo
  project; VM setup script written and ready to run at H0 (first real test on the VM).
- P3: test the gateway through OpenRouter if pre-contest code is allowed; only the Vertex and Bedrock adapters wait for H0.
- P1: members added as GitHub collaborators; OpenRouter key with a spending limit (fallback only); cloud
  service-account credentials shared only through a password manager; first draft of `app/schemas.py`.
- P4: pick the 2–3 golden topics (match the pre-generated list) and gather their source pages.
- P1, **contract review**: share the Contracts section; each lane checks only the contracts it produces or consumes and
  replies "OK" or lists concrete problems by a set deadline (silence is not agreement); P1 answers every objection and
  decides. This is the draft; the H3 freeze is still the final check.
- P2, **Spec Kit**: `uv tool install specify-cli`, `specify init` with the Claude Code integration (confirm the flag with
  `specify init --help`), check the command names (`/speckit-…`), write the constitution from `CLAUDE.md`, and check
  how it handles feature branches. Ask the organizers whether this setup may be committed before H0.
- P5, **MCP**: add the Figma MCP (if designing in Figma) and shadcn MCP to Claude Code in local scope
  (`claude mcp add --scope local …`) and test that the agent can read a frame. Tokens (e.g. the Figma personal access
  token) stay in local config or `.env`, never in a commit or in chat.
- P1: name **P2 as deputy lead** (decides while P1 sleeps); agree the sleep slots below with everyone.
- **Only if pre-contest code is allowed (3):** P1 drafts `app/schemas.py` (H1 becomes a review) and migration `0003`; P2
  switches `conftest.py` to a throwaway schema and merges `0003`; **if (2) is also "yes"**, P3 downloads the library
  and P2 indexes it, so H3–H7 only checks size and retrieval quality.
- Everyone: Git, Python 3.12, `uv`, their AI coding agent; own Supabase dev project (for running tests) and keys in
  `.env`. Laptops need no GPU and no Docker; 8 GB RAM is enough, 16 GB is comfortable; keep a few GB of disk free.
- P5: Node.js 20 + pnpm.

## Contracts (draft by H1, frozen at H3; only P1 changes them, announced at a checkpoint)

### Knowledge Graph (P4 writes, P1 + P5 read) — stored in the DB; YAML for fixtures and golden topics
```yaml
concepts:
  - slug: photosynthesis-light-reactions   # kebab-case, unique per subject
    name_vi: Pha sáng của quang hợp
    name_en: Light reactions
    description_vi: ...
    sources: ["https://openstax.org/books/biology-2e/pages/..."]
edges:                                      # prerequisite -> concept; loader rejects cycles
  - {from: cell-structure, to: photosynthesis-light-reactions}
```

### Items (P4 writes, P1 + P3 read) — MCQ only
```yaml
concept: photosynthesis-light-reactions
misconceptions:
  - {slug: oxygen-from-co2, description_vi: "Nghĩ rằng O2 sinh ra từ CO2"}
items:
  - id: plr-001
    kind: mcq
    prompt_vi: "Oxy sinh ra trong quang hợp có nguồn gốc từ đâu?"
    difficulty: 0.4
    source: "https://openstax.org/..."
    chunk_ids: ["7f3c…", "a91e…"]   # the generator's citations; the verifier sees only these chunks
    status: verified                  # verified | needs_review (needs_review items are never served)
    options:
      - {label: "Từ nước (H2O)", correct: true}
      - {label: "Từ CO2", correct: false, misconception: oxygen-from-co2}
```
Every wrong option has a `misconception`; every item has a `source` and `chunk_ids`. **Verification gate** (`SPEC.md`):
the verifier answers the item blind from its cited chunks only; a mismatch or no answer sets `needs_review`, and only
`verified` items are served.

### Golden topics (P4, `data/golden/<slug>/`)
Each holds the source chunks, a hand-checked `graph.yaml`, ~15 hand-checked items and their expected answers. Uses:
real test data for P1, P3 and P5 from H3; the labelled sample for `guardrails/metrics.py`; safe fallback demo topics.

### API (FastAPI, JSON; Pydantic models in `app/schemas.py`). P2 ships all routes as **stubs with fixture data** by H3.
Route owner = who writes the endpoint; logic comes from the lanes in brackets.
| Method & path | Route owner | Request → Response |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /learners` | P2 | `{display_name}` → `{learner_id}` |
| `POST /topics` | P3 (pipeline P3 + P4, retrieval P1) | `{goal_vi?, upload_id?, mode: "quick"\|"deep", tier: "free"\|"pro"}` → `{topic_id, cached}` |
| `GET /topics/{id}` | P2 | → `{status: queued\|researching\|indexing\|graph\|items\|ready\|failed, step_vi, progress, subject_slug?, graph_ready, items_ready, sources: [{title, publisher, url, license}], trail: [{at, kind: search\|read\|select, text_vi, url?}]}` (current state from `topic_jobs`; used to recover after a dropped stream) |
| `GET /topics/{id}/events` | P2 | SSE stream of the same fields as they change, plus a `heartbeat` event every 15–20 s |
| `GET /topics/cached` | P2 | → `{topics: [{subject_slug, name_vi}]}` |
| `POST /uploads` | P3 | multipart PDF/DOCX or `{url}` → `{upload_id, pages, text_ok}` |
| `GET /graph?learner_id=&subject=` | P3 (engine P1) | → `{nodes: [{slug, name_vi, p_known, mastered}], edges: [{from, to}]}` |
| `POST /placement/next` | P3 (engine P1) | `{learner_id, subject}` → `{item \| null, done, gap_slug?, trace: DecisionTrace}` |
| `GET /next-item?learner_id=&subject=` | P3 (engine P1) | → `{item, reason_vi}` |
| `POST /attempts` | P3 (grading P3, engine P1) | `{learner_id, item_id, answer, hints_used}` → `{correct, misconception_vi?, p_known, mastered, remediation?: {concept_slug, reason_vi}, traces: [DecisionTrace]}` |
| `POST /tutor/hint` | P3 (tutor P4) | `{learner_id, item_id, level, last_answer?, tier}` → `{hint_vi, citations: [{title, section, url}]}` |
| `POST /ask` | P3 (retrieval P1) | `{question, subject, tier}` → `{answer_vi, citations}` |
| `GET /reviews/due?learner_id=` | P3 (engine P1) | → `{cards: [{concept_slug, due_at}]}` |
| `POST /exam-plan` | P3 (engine P1) | `{learner_id, subject, exam_date}` → `{days: [{date, concept_slugs, minutes}]}` |

`item` sent to the web never contains the answer: `{id, kind, prompt_vi, options: [{label}]}`.

### Python interfaces
- `app/rag/embed.py::Embedder.embed(texts) -> list[list[float]]` (P1; exists; add TEI, managed-API and HF-hosted
  implementations; the managed API needs a re-index).
- `app/rag/retrieve.py::search(query, subject, k=5) -> list[Citation]` (P1).
- `app/rag/rerank.py` (P1, optional): rerank retrieved chunks (e.g. `bge-reranker-v2-m3`); only if H8 retrieval is weak.
- `app/llm/gateway.py::complete(task, tier, system, messages, schema=None) -> str | BaseModel` (P3) — reads
  `routing.yaml`, validates JSON with Pydantic, retries, falls back to the next model. Nothing else imports an LLM SDK.
- `app/research/agent.py::research(goal, on_event) -> list[ChosenSource]` (P3) — allowlisted domains only,
  ≤ 15 searches, ≤ 12 page reads, 8-minute cap.
- `app/engine/bkt.py`, `app/engine/srs.py` (P1; exist): pure, no DB.
- `app/engine/graph.py` (P1): prerequisite DAG helpers + `root_cause(graph, mastery, failed_slug) -> (concept_slug, trace)`
  (walk prerequisites to the weakest one). Pure, no DB.
- `app/engine/placement.py` (P1): `next_question(graph, answers) -> (slug | None, trace)` and `gap(graph, answers) -> slug`,
  the graph-walk placement below. Pure, no DB.
- `app/services/` (P2): load/save attempts, mastery, traces and review cards; the engine never touches the DB.
- `app/guardrails/answerability.py` (P4): `check(text, cited_chunks) -> Verdict{supported, reason}`, used on every
  generated item before it is stored and on every tutor hint before it is shown.
- `app/guardrails/metrics.py` (P4, evaluation design P1): runs the checks over the labelled set in `data/guardrails/`
  (built from the golden topics) and reports error rate, catch rate and false alarms; the numbers go on the dashboard.
- `app/tutor/hints.py::hint(item, level, last_answer, chunks, tier) -> Hint` (P4): Socratic hint ladder via the gateway,
  checked by `answerability` before it is returned.

### Placement (graph walk, P1)
Start at an advanced concept. Correct → mark its prerequisites as known (raise `p_known`) and move to the next
unknown branch. Wrong → ask about one of its prerequisites. Stop after ~6 questions or when the gap is located;
return `gap_slug`. BKT keeps updating mastery after every later attempt.

### DecisionTrace (P1 defines in `app/engine/trace.py`; P5 renders)
`{kind, concept_slug, at, prior, evidence: {item_id?, correct?, misconception?, slip?, guess?}, posterior, rule, rule_vi,
alternatives: [{concept_slug, p_known, why_not_vi}]}` — pure data from the engine, stored per learner (migration `0004`,
via P2's services), returned by `/placement/next` and `/attempts`, shown in the web app's "Vì sao?" panel. `bkt.update`
and `srs.review` stay unchanged; traced wrappers (`update_traced`, `review_traced`) and `graph.root_cause` /
`placement.next_question` return `(result, trace)`.

## Two modes
| | Nhanh (NotebookLM-style) | Nghiên cứu sâu (Deep Research) |
|---|---|---|
| Sources | Curated library + learner's upload | Agent searches and reads the allowlist live |
| Time | < 60 s to the graph + first ~6 placement questions; remaining items generated in the background (measured at H8) | target 3–5 min, cap 8 min |
| Tier | Free (cheap models) | Pro (strong models) |

Allowlist (`data/sources/allowlist.yaml`, P3 writes, P1 approves): OpenStax, LibreTexts, MIT OpenCourseWare, Saylor
Academy, Open Textbook Library, Wikibooks; Wikipedia last resort, labelled. No "ND" licences; licence recorded per source.
Deep Research quality bar: ≥ 3 sources from ≥ 2 publishers; prerequisites from the sources' chapter order and
objectives; everything cited; answerability-checked items.

## Timeline (H0 = kickoff)
| Window | P1 Lead + ML core | P2 Platform | P3 Agents & integration | P4 Content & tutor | P5 Web |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **H0–H1** | **Draft contracts** (`schemas.py`, YAML formats, `DecisionTrace`); migration `0003` (`halfvec`, `url` → `source_uri`); one-page engine spec in `specs/engine/` | **Throwaway-schema `conftest.py` first** (everyone runs tests from H1); repo, CI, FastAPI skeleton, schema on Supabase, **review and merge P1's migration `0003`**, Spec Kit setup (if not done before H0); **minute 0: check GPU quota on both clouds, request it if missing, enable Vertex AI and Bedrock, set budget alerts; decide GPU or CPU VM by H1**; start the VM | Allowlist + downloader/HTML reader; gateway skeleton (own folders) | **Golden topic #1** (chunks, graph, ~15 items) | Next.js skeleton, Sena assets |
| **H1–H3** | BKT/FSRS traced wrappers, `graph.py`; retrieval on golden topic #1 | API stubs from the contracts; **TEI container serving bge-m3** (H2); tunnel, Watchtower, backup VM image | **Library download starts** (priority order, H1–H5); first Vertex AI call through the gateway; file reader | **Golden topics #2–3**; graph-generation prompt on a sample chapter | Map + "Vì sao?" panel on **mock JSON** |
| **H3** checkpoint | Contracts frozen; golden topics 1–2 ready; engine and UI tested on real data; bge-m3 measured on the VM; migration `0003` merged; first books downloaded | | | | |
| **H3–H7** | `placement.py`, `DecisionTrace` everywhere; retrieval evaluation on golden topic #1 only | **Library indexing** on the indexing GPU VM with P1's code (H5–H7), size check, HNSW after load; `topic_jobs` queue + worker + SSE with heartbeat; database layer; structlog + Langfuse | **Bedrock call through the gateway (by H5)**; library download done (H5); grading; real routes for topics, graph, placement, attempts, uploads; Nhanh mode wiring | Pipeline graph → items; verification gate (Bedrock verifier; OpenRouter fallback of another family) | Topic input + upload, map, learning screen; switch to real routes as they land |
| **H7** integration | P1, P3, P4, P5 pieces due at H8 are merged (P1: `placement.py`, `retrieve.py`). **H7–H8: first end-to-end run of Nhanh** (P1 leads, everyone fixes) | | | | |
| **H8** checkpoint | Nhanh end to end on **3 unfamiliar topics** (if the library is not indexed yet, use 3 uploaded files instead). Library indexed, DB < 350 MB; migrations `0003`–`0007` merged; Bedrock reachable; Nhanh time measured. Not solid → whole team on Nhanh + pre-generated topics; Deep Research becomes a bonus. Pick Free/Pro models from the Vietnamese test. P1 decides on the reranker. | | | | |
| **H8–H11** | Root-cause remediation rules; reranker if needed; engine tests on varied graph shapes; retrieval evaluation on the other golden topics | Integration, dashboard, deploy hardening | Deep Research agent; routes for tutor, ask, reviews, exam-plan, next-item | Tutor prompts + hint ladder; quality across subject types | Research-trail + tutor screens, Free/Pro switch |
| **H11–H12** | Everyone plays judge with an unfamiliar topic; measure time + cost per mode (nobody sleeps) | | | | |
| **H12** | P1 decides: Deep Research live on stage, or shown as a recording | | | | |
| **H12–H18** | Metrics review with P4; tutor evaluation ≥ 18/20 with P4; algorithm part of the pitch. Sleep H12:00–H13:30 | Pre-generate topics, monitoring; deputy lead while P1 sleeps. Sleep H16:00–H17:30 | Fixes. Sleep H13:30–H15:00 | Label 50 items + 20 hints in **H15–H16** (whole team, nobody sleeps), run `guardrails/metrics.py`. Sleep H13:30–H15:00 | Polish, manual E2E checklist. Sleep H12:00–H13:30 |
| **H18** freeze | Tag `demo-v1` (P2) | | | | |
| **H18–H23** | Demo script + pitch; 3 clean runs with unseen topics, timed to the research | | | | **Backup video** |
| **H23–H24** | Buffer | | | | |

**Real routes at H8** (no stubs): `POST /topics`, `GET /topics/{id}` + `/events`, `POST /uploads`, `GET /graph`,
`POST /placement/next`, `POST /attempts`. **Stubs allowed until H11:** `/tutor/hint`, `/ask`, `/next-item`,
`/reviews/due`, `/exam-plan`.

**Sleep:** about 90 min each inside H12–H18, in three back-to-back blocks so no more than two people are ever asleep:
P1 + P5 H12:00–H13:30 (right after the H12 decision), P3 + P4 H13:30–H15:00, P2 H16:00–H17:30. Never two who are
waiting on each other; nobody sleeps during H11–H12, the labelling hour (H15–H16) or H17:30–H18. While P1 sleeps,
**P2 decides**; while P3 sleeps, P2 handles route bugs; while P4 sleeps, P1 covers content questions; while P2 sleeps,
P3 watches the VM and merges green PRs.

## Git workflow
- Branch per lane: `p1/ml-core`, `p2/platform`, `p3/integration`, `p4/content`, `p5/web`; one worktree per extra agent.
- **Rebase at every checkpoint**: `git fetch && git rebase origin/main`, then run tests.
- PR title `[P3] ...`; CI green; P2 merges routine PRs, P1 approves contract changes. Stacked PRs: **retarget to `main`
  before deleting the base branch**.
- Migrations reserved, numbered in merge order: `0003` P1 (`halfvec`, `chunks.url` → `source_uri`, HNSW rebuilt),
  `0004` P1 (`decision_traces`), `0005` P4 (`items.chunk_ids`, `items.status`), `0006` P2 (`topic_jobs`, `llm_calls`),
  `0007` P3 (uploads). `supabase/migrations/` belongs to P2, but **each reserved file is written by its lane and reviewed
  and merged by P2** (the one exception to lane-owned paths). Additive only, except `0003` (type change, rename, index
  rebuild). P2 merges them in number order, so every database (demo, CI, dev) applies them in the same order.
- Dependencies via `uv add` / `pnpm add` in your own PR; on lockfile conflicts take `main`'s and re-lock.
- **Secrets:** each person has their own Supabase dev project and keys in `.env`. Demo keys only via a password manager.

## Working with your AI agent
`CLAUDE.md` does not auto-load this file. Each person has a short start guide in `team/` (`P1.md`–`P5.md`): setup, first
task, first prompt. Before H0, copy `CLAUDE.local.md.example` to `CLAUDE.local.md` (git-ignored) and set your number, so
every session knows its lane. Other coding agents may not load these files: tell them to read `CLAUDE.md` and your guide.
Check it works by asking the agent "Which lane are you, which paths do you own, and what is your first task at H0?"
First prompt (copy and fill in):
> You are working on lane **P_ (name)** in `TEAM.md`. Only edit the paths that lane owns.
> Task: **(your row in the timeline for the current window)**. First run `/speckit-specify`, `/speckit-plan` and
> `/speckit-tasks` for it (one page each). Follow the contracts in `TEAM.md` exactly; if one seems wrong, stop and tell me.
> Use fixtures or golden topics for anything another lane owns. When done: run tests, update `MAP.md`, write a PR
> description.

Agent rules: never push to `main`, never edit another lane's files, never change a contract, never read `.env`.

## Definition of done (every PR)
pytest + ruff green; new logic has tests; no real LLM/network calls in tests; user-facing text in Vietnamese;
explanations cited; contract shapes exact; `MAP.md` updated.

## Risks and fallbacks
| Risk | Fallback | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| Contracts late past H1 / foundation late past H3 | Lanes keep working on golden topics, mock JSON and their own folders; P1 does nothing but contracts in H0–H1 | P1, P2 |
| Tunnel URL changes or SSE stream drops mid-research | Named tunnel on own domain; heartbeat every 15–20 s; web reconnects and reloads `GET /topics/{id}` | P2, P5 |
| Primary VM down | Start the backup VM on the other cloud (same image + compose + tunnel token); `/health` check; Render/Railway last resort | P2 |
| No GPU quota by H1 (cloud opens only at H0) | CPU VM (8 vCPU / 32 GB) with the TEI CPU image; swap primary cloud if the other approves first; bulk indexing on Colab writing to Supabase (same bge-m3 model, no re-index) | P2, P1 |
| Google Cloud unavailable (VM by H1, Vertex by H3; decide each separately) | **VM:** AWS `g4dn.xlarge` → AWS CPU VM; same Docker setup, keep bge-m3 (no re-index). **Models:** reorder `routing.yaml`: cheap model on Bedrock, Gemini through OpenRouter for graph extraction (or Claude on Bedrock with smaller inputs). **Verifier stays another family than the generator.** Raise the OpenRouter spending limit on purpose (real money, not credits). AWS also blocked: personal Google account if allowed (Vertex + CPU VM), last resort a laptop with Docker and the tunnel + OpenRouter | P2 (VM), P3 (models), P1 decides |
| Cloud access closes before the final demo | Confirm the closing time with the organizers; if it closes first, keep a recording and move the API to a surviving account before H23 | P1, P2 |
| Cloud credits burn (GPU VM left running) | Budget alerts on both clouds; delete the indexing VM right after use; backup VM stays stopped | P2 |
| Vertex model access missing or rate-limited | Gateway falls through to Bedrock, then OpenRouter (`routing.yaml` order) | P3 |
| bge-m3 too slow, or TEI / GPU driver fails | TEI CPU image → HF hosted bge-m3 → managed multilingual embedding API on Bedrock/Vertex (**requires re-indexing**) | P1, P2 |
| Long-context graph extraction too slow or costly | Fall back to chapter-by-chapter extraction with the same chunk-ID markers | P4, P3 |
| Docker image too heavy (10–20 min per update) | API image has no ML runtime; bge-m3 weights mounted into the TEI container; multi-stage `uv` build | P2 |
| Network blocks QUIC/UDP, tunnel won't connect | `cloudflared --protocol http2`; `restart: unless-stopped` | P2 |
| VM runs out of RAM or GPU memory | Only TEI holds the model (API and worker call it over HTTP); measure memory at H3 | P2, P1 |
| Database exceeds Supabase free tier | `halfvec`, ~30k-chunk budget, size check per book, HNSW after load; Supabase Pro for a month | P1 |
| Knowledge-map nodes overlap | `dagre`/`elkjs` auto-layout from H0; test shallow/deep and small/large graphs | P5 |
| Deep Research slow, wrong or off-allowlist | 8-min cap → Nhanh → pre-generated topic; domain filter in code | P3, P4, P2 |
| Judge picks a topic with no open textbook | Wikibooks/Wikipedia labelled as encyclopedia; state the limit openly | P3 |
| Generated question wrong in front of judges | Verification gate on every item and hint (verifier from a different model family), measured error rate from `metrics.py`, "Bản nháp tự động" label, rehearse many subject types | P4 |
| Cheap model returns bad JSON or weak Vietnamese | Pydantic validation + retry, fallback model list, H8 Vietnamese test | P3, P1 |
| Engine/UI only works for one graph shape | Test shallow/deep, small/large graphs (golden topics differ on purpose); vary topics at every checkpoint | P1, P5 |
| Uploaded file is scanned, table-heavy or has broken fonts | Check text on upload, ask for another file or link, page cap, rehearse with 5–10 real files | P3 |
| Deep Research not ready, team has no data to test with | Golden topics from H3 cover the engine, retrieval and UI without Deep Research | P4 |
| LLM cost too high | Measure at H11; lower effort, fewer sources (P1 decides); budget alerts on both clouds, spending limit on OpenRouter | P1, P2 |
| Web not ready at H18 | Scripted happy path only; backup video | P5 |
| Library not downloaded or indexed by H8 | Download from H1, index H5–H7 (pre-H0 if allowed); H8 test runs on uploaded files instead | P3, P2 |
| P1 overloaded (contracts, engine, retrieval, decisions) | P2 runs indexing; retrieval evaluation on one golden topic before H8; P2 tracks the critical path at checkpoints | P1, P2 |
| Bedrock unreachable (no cross-family verifier) | Verifier falls back to an OpenRouter model of another family than the generator; stated in `routing.yaml` | P3, P4 |
| Team exhausted after H14 (mistakes during labelling and freeze) | Staggered 90-min sleep slots in H12–H18; deputy lead (P2) | P1 |
| Venue wifi fails | Pre-generated topics + golden topics + backup video | P2, P1 |

## Demo acceptance (run at every checkpoint after H8)
1. A teammate plays judge with an unseen topic, or uploads a file → research trail shows allowlisted sources. *(P3, P5)*
2. Path ready (Nhanh: graph + first placement questions < 60 s; Deep Research < 8 min) with a cited knowledge map. *(P3, P4, P5)*
3. Graph-walk placement in ~6 questions locates a gap; the map lights up; "Vì sao?" explains the choice. *(P1, P5)*
4. Wrong answer → remediation to the weak prerequisite; hint asked → Socratic hint in Vietnamese with citations, no final answer. *(P1, P4)*
5. Correct answer → mastery rises, Sena praises understanding, a review is scheduled. *(P1, P5)*
6. Dashboard shows time, cost and dropped questions for that topic, plus the measured guardrail error rate. *(P2, P4)*
