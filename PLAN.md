# PLAN — build order

## Current: 24-hour team build
The contest build runs as the H0–H24 plan in `TEAM.md` (5 lanes, contracts frozen at H3, scope decision at H8,
integration run H7–H8, feature freeze at H18). If this summary and `TEAM.md` disagree, `TEAM.md` wins. Milestones:

| Hour | Milestone |
|---|---|
| H3 | Repo, CI (throwaway-schema tests), schema + migration `0003` (`halfvec`), contracts + API stubs, cloud GPU VM + tunnel, bge-m3 measured, first Vertex AI call, library download started |
| H5 | Library downloaded; Bedrock reachable through the gateway |
| H7 | Pieces due at H8 merged; library indexed; first end-to-end Nhanh run |
| H8 | Nhanh mode end to end on 3 unfamiliar topics; Free/Pro models chosen; migrations `0003`–`0007` merged |
| H12 | Deep Research decision (live on stage or recording) |
| H18 | Feature freeze, tag `demo-v1` |
| H23 | 3 clean rehearsals, backup video |

Already on `main` before the contest (reuse only if the organizers allow pre-contest code): schema 0001–0002,
BKT + FSRS engine, Think Python ingestion pipeline.

## After the contest
| When | Goal |
|---|---|
| Months 1–2 | Pilot with one real class; login; move the API to an always-on host |
| Months 3–4 | Launch Free + Pro; lecturer class view |
| Months 5–9 | More subjects, learning-gain study, partnerships with centers and universities |

## Long-term phases (reference)
Each phase should be finished properly (tests, docs) before the next. Estimates assume ~20 h/week solo.

| # | Phase | Key deliverables | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Harness | CLAUDE.md, MAP, SPEC, PLAN, git, env | done |
| 1 | Scaffolding | Monorepo, `apps/api` (FastAPI + uv), `apps/web` (Next.js), Supabase local, CI lint/test | todo |
| 2 | Data model | Schema: users, subjects, sources, chunks, concepts, edges, items, misconceptions, attempts, mastery, cards | todo |
| 3 | Learning Engine | BKT, Elo, FSRS, rule engine as pure tested modules | todo |
| 4 | Ingestion + RAG | Textbook ingest → chunks → embeddings (pgvector) → cited retrieval; LLM gateway | todo |
| 5 | Knowledge Graph builder | Extract concepts + prerequisites from sources; graph review tools | todo |
| 6 | Assessment | Placement test, adaptive quiz, misconception-tagged distractors, graders | todo |
| 7 | Adaptive path | Root-cause remediation over the graph | todo |
| 8 | Socratic tutor | Hint ladder, citations, no direct answers | todo |
| 9 | Frontend | Sena UI, graph view, quiz, tutor chat, vi/en i18n | todo |
| 10 | Notes + review | Block notes → cards, FSRS review, exam backward scheduler | todo |
| 11 | Class view | Lecturer dashboards, class weak spots | todo |

## Decisions made
- Demo: the judge's own topic or uploaded file; no pre-built subject. MCQ only.
- Web: Next.js on Vercel. API: FastAPI in Docker on a Google Cloud GPU VM in Singapore (AWS backup VM, roles swappable), via a named Cloudflare Tunnel; organizer cloud credits, open at H0 (GPU or CPU decided by H1).
- Data: Supabase (Postgres + pgvector `halfvec`, Storage), ~30k-chunk budget. Jobs: Postgres `topic_jobs` queue + worker service (Redis after the contest).
- Embeddings: BAAI/bge-m3, 1024 dims, served by a TEI container on the API VM (GPU or CPU image); bulk indexing with the same image on a temporary GPU VM.
- LLM model roles: long-context Gemini on Vertex for graph extraction; verifier always a different model family from the generator (e.g. Claude on Bedrock); Pro tutor on Claude, confirmed at H8.
- LLM: gateway with Vertex AI primary, Bedrock and OpenRouter fallbacks; per-tier routing (Free = cheap models, Pro = strong models).
- Planning: GitHub Spec Kit for every lane (examiner's request), one page per document, constitution from `CLAUDE.md`. CI: pytest + ruff required, mypy warn-only.
- Frontend agent reads designs through MCP (Figma, shadcn, browser), configured locally per person.

## Open decisions
- Licensing beyond the demo: Think Python text is CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 — fine for a non-commercial demo,
  but any commercial NodeTrail needs another source or permission, and material derived from the text
  (e.g. generated quiz items) must keep attribution and the same license.
